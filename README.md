# Downslope - Unity2D Arcade Skiing Game
- THIS GAME IS NOT FULLY COMPLETE
- In its current state, it is a demo of the game mechanics which can be played infinitely.
There is no UI structure, health / score system, menus, goals, rewards, or any meaningful gameplay.
This is all coming soon.
- It does contain full player control, partial asset management, sounds, and randomly generated levels.

# How to Play
 1. Load up the only scene right now, SampleScene.
 2. Press SPACE to start.
 3. Use A and D to Carve left and right.
 4. Use SPACE to Brake. Braking + Carving allows you to Carve twice as fast.
 5. Dodge trees and obstacles, some obstacles can slow you while others can stun you.
 6. Ramps launch you in the air, with increased air time the faster you are going.

The sounds are from various SSX games that I sliced and then filtered through a bit reduction vst. (BitCrusher)
